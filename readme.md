## Auth

The auth is classified into two,

- Authentication
- Authorization

**Authentication (AuthN)**

- Authentication is the process of **proving your identity** to a system.
- Who are you?

**Authorization (AuthZ)**

- Authorization is about **deciding what you can access or do** *after* youâ€™re authenticated.
- What are you allowed to do?

### Authentication methods

- Stateful (Session + Cookies)
- Stateless (JWT)

### Stateful Authentication

**Server remembers session state** for every logged-in user.

**How it works:**

1. You log in with username & password.
2. Server verifies and creates a **session record** in memory or DB.
    - Example: `{ userId: 101, sessionId: 'abc123' }`
3. Server sends a **session ID** back to you, stored in a **cookie**.
4. Every request â†’ you send cookie â†’ server looks up session in DB/memory â†’ âœ… valid.

**How to secure sessions:**

- Use **HTTPS** (so cookies arenâ€™t sniffed in network).
- Use **HttpOnly cookies** â†’ JavaScript canâ€™t access them.
- Use **Secure cookies** â†’ only sent over HTTPS.
- Rotate session IDs after login.
- Use short expiry and revalidation.

**ðŸ”‘ Session Auth â€“ Behind the Scenes (BTS)**

1. **Login** â†’ client sends username & password â†’ server verifies â†’ creates a `sessionId`.
2. **Server stores** â†’ `sessionId` linked with user in memory/DB.
3. **Response** â†’ server sends back cookie:
    
    ```
    Set-Cookie: sessionId=xyz; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
    ```
    
4. **Subsequent requests** â†’ browser automatically attaches cookie:
    
    ```
    Cookie: sessionId=xyz
    ```
    
    Server validates and returns data.
    
5. **Logout** â†’ session removed from server â†’ cookie becomes invalid.

**ðŸ”‘ Cookie Security Flags**

- `HttpOnly` â†’ cannot be accessed by JS (prevents XSS).
- `Secure` â†’ only via HTTPS.
- `SameSite=Strict` â†’ blocks CSRF by not sending cookies cross-site.

**ðŸ”‘ Frontend Usage**

- Use `credentials: "include"` in `fetch`/`axios` so cookies travel with requests.

**Example:**

```
    fetch("http://localhost:3000/login", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ username: "john", password: "1234" }),
    credentials: "include"   // ðŸ”¥ important
    });
```
